    <h1>Know Your Rights – The Skater's Guide</h1>
    <p>This guide was created by <strong>Sunny</strong>, a skater turned law student, passionate about using the law to empower the scene that raised him.</p>
    
    <h2>About Sunny</h2>

    <p>Whether you’re out filming clips or just chilling at your local, this guide helps you understand the rights you’ve got — and how to use them confidently.</p>

    <h2>The Code of Lawyer Skaters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Respect the session</strong> — but know your legal rights if it's shut down</li>
      <li><strong>Know the law</strong> — so you can protect your friends and your freedom</li>
      <li><strong>Use your platform</strong> — teach others and pass it on</li>
      <li><strong>Build, don’t just destroy</strong> — the system’s broken, but we’re not helpless</li>
    </ul>
